In this branch we describe how to use the new general modeling framework GreatMod, especially the R library *epimod*,  to  study  one of the simplest
epidemiological  system: SIR.

The purpose of this guide is to help beginner users to fraternize with the R pakcage *epimod*, by following an easy step by step guide. We suggest to download the pdf called "Eserzio.pdf" by clicking on it and successively on the button "download".

All the R scripts and the functions exploited throught the lesson are reported in the following folders:

1. **Rfunction**: the R scripts encoding the functions to use for generating the plots regarding the model analysis and the calibration analysis, and the scripts concerning the functions passed to the *calibration.analysis* function;
2. **Net**: the PNPRO file representing the Petri Net SIR model draen with GreatSPN;
3. **Input**: all the csv files encoding the paramters values to pass to the *model.analysis* and *calibration.analysis* functions;
4. **Main.R**: the main R script to run for generating the entire analysis.

This branch has already exploited to teach how to use GreatMod at the Master of Epidemiology 2020-2021, University of Turin, during the lecture: 
"Epidemiological modeling using the GreatMod framework", Friday 8 October 9:00-11.00.
