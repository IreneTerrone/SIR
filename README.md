# SIR
In this repository you can find four examples of use of *epimod*:

- **SIR**: one of the simplest epidemiological system (homogeneous mixing); the purpose of this example is to help beginner users to fraternize with the R pakcage epimod, by following an easy step by step guide. We suggest to download the pdf called "SIR/Exercise.pdf" by clicking on it and successively on the button "download".
- **SIR_simple**: one of the simplest epidemiological system (homogeneous mixing); the purpose of this example is to show that with the *model_calibration* function you can estimate the rates inside your system (*Infection* and *Recovery* rate in this case) to try to align your model to real data (also called reference data).
- **SIR_age**: SIR with age stratification; the purpose of this example is to show that you can introduce the age stratification inside a population in a few steps using the PN formalism; with the age stratification you can also introduce different *Infection* rates that depend on the particular age classes of the considered individuals.
- **SIR_age_vaccination**: SIR with age stratification and vaccination; the purpose of this example is to show that you can also introduce the vaccination to implement different vaccination strategies inside the population with the age stratification to contain the infection inside a particular age class or on the overall population in general.
