In this branch we describe how to use the new general modeling framework GreatMod, especially the R library *epimod*,  to  study  one of the simplest
epidemiological  system: SIR. The purpose of this guide is to help the students of the Master of Epidemiology 2020-2021, University of Turin, during the lecture: 
"Epidemiological modeling using the GreatMod framework", Friday 8 October 9:00-11.00.

We suggest to download the pdf called "Eserzio.pdf" by clicking on it and successively on the button "download".

All the R scripts and the functions exploited trhought the lesson are reported in the following folders:

1. **Rfunction**: the R scripts encoding the functions to use for generating the plots regarding the model analysis and the calibration analysis, and the scripts concerning the functions passed to the *calibration_analysis* function;
2. **Net**: the PNPRO file representing the Petri Net SIR model draen with GreatSPN;
3. **Input**: all the csv files encoding the paramters values to pass to the *model_analysis* and *calibration_analysis* functions;
4. **Main.R**: the main R script to run for generating the entire analysis.
